# Moving App

## How to Run the Application

1. **Backend (Python)**
   - Run the following command to start the backend:
     ```sh
     python3 movers.py
     ```
     Or, if `python3` is not installed, try:
     ```sh
     python movers.py
     ```

2. **Frontend (React/NPM)**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```sh
     cd moving-app-frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies (if not already installed):
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend application:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```

## Notes
- Ensure you have **Python 3** installed for the backend.
- Ensure you have **Node.js and npm** installed for the frontend.
- If you encounter issues, check for missing dependencies and install them accordingly.
